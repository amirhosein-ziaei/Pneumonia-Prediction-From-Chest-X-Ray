This repository contains my Deep Learning Project which was about Predicting Pneumonia in a given dataset from Kaggle 
Here's a picture of my **classes** which contains Normal and Pneumonia:

Because the dataset is too big, I didn't upload it and here is kaggle link which you can download the dataset or upload the dataset to the colab directly
In uploaded notebook I upload the dataset to the colab directly and save it to the google drive.

To download the dataset use this link [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
